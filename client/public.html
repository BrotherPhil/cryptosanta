      <p>Add a crypto wrinkle to your Kris Kringle! Make your Secret Santa even more secret with the magic of Onion Wrapping!  How?  You wrap your gift three times according to the Crypto Santa instructions.  Each layer of wrapping has the name of someone at your party. Use newspaper or other scrap paper for the outer and intermediate layers and save the nice stuff for the inside.  On each layer you will be instructed to address the present to another member of your party. Bring the thrice-wrapped present to the party and watch it route to its destination. By the time the present reaches its randomly chosen recipient it will have been completely anonymized!</p>

<template name="about">
  <h1>What Is Crypto Santa?</h1>
  <p>Crypto Santa is a version of "secret Santa" that obscures the origin of the gift-giver using a technique called onion routing. This is the same technique used by Tor, a system for browsing the web anonymously. However, instead of using data encryption, Cryto Santa uses Onion Wrapping.</p>
  <h1>What Is Onion Wrapping?</h1>
   <p>Onion Wrapping is done by wrapping your gift three extra times. First you, the original Santa, wrap your gift and label it with the person who is intended to receive the gift. Then you wrap it again, and add the name of another colleague, this is the exit Santa. Then you wrap it again and add the name of yet another colleague, this is the middle Santa, then finally you wrap it once more, this is the entry Santa.</p>
   <p>Now your Onion Wrapped gift is ready to bring to the party. Once there, you give the gift to the entry Santa, who unwraps the gift to reveal the identity of the middle Santa and pass it on, the middle Santa unwraps the gift to find the exit Santa, who unwraps it and finally gives it to the recipient.</p>
  <h1>How Does This Work?</h1>
  <p>To start your own Crypto Party event, just log in to this site, create your event, add the email addresses of the people you want to participate in it, once all the people are added, start the event and the system will organize all the participants so that everyone gives and receives a gift, and all Santas have the onion wrapping instructions so that they know how to wrap their gift. The system chooses the recipient, the exit Santa, middle Santa and entry Santa for them.</p>
